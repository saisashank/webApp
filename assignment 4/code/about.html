<center><img  src="about.jpg" alt="Club Logo2" height="300" width="400"></center><br>

The Bangalore Hi-Fliers are the Premier Hockey League(PHL) team from the IT Hub 
of India, Bangalore, Karnataka. The team is led by Tushar Khandekar, a member of 
Indian Hockey team. They were previously named the Bangalore Lions because of 
sponsorship reasons.<br><br>

Bangalore Hi-Fliers is currently the most successful team in the Premier Hockey 
League, they won the league twice in 2006 and 2008, beating Chandigarh 
Dynamos on both occasion in the play-offs.<br><br>

<b>Founding  </b><br><br>
The club was formed on the back grounds of inaugural Premier Hockey League in 
year 2005. It started off with many host of hockey superstars from India, 
Pakistan and Malaysia. Hi-Fliers is the only teams who in every edition of 
the PHL displayed tactical and strategic hockey. They have had a good mix 
of young and experienced players. In the first edition at Hyderabad, their 
squad had as many as seven members from the national team. They played well 
in the first leg but failed to maintain the same tempo in the second set of 
matches and finished a disappointing fourth in the first edition.<br><br>

<b>Lions Era (2006-2007) </b><br><br>
Team's name was changed to Lions in 2006,the team played brilliantly 
throughout and finished as the second team in the league to enter the 
best-of-three finals and pipped local favourites Chandigarh Dynamos to 
win the second edition. In the third final, Bangalore's Hariprasad scored 
a classic goal - that one effort earned him a place in the Indian team for 
the Asian Games and the World Cup. In the third edition, Bangalore failed 
to make it to the final by three points and finished third. <br><br>

<b>2008 </b><br><br>
Team's name was again changed in 2008 and they were now called 
Bangalore Hi-fliers. Hi-fliers went on to win the league in 2008. The greatest 
strength of the team is their star penalty corner specialist Len Aiyappa.  
The team's fortunes depend on the ability of their forwardline to get enough 
short corners for Len to click. Bangalore had eight internationals in their 
team and is also served by one of the best goalkeepers in the country, 
Bharath Kumar Chetri. Its Korean import You Hyo-sik has the ability to 
make speedy runs and he was an asset to the team. They also had two more 
foreign players Oliver Rutgers and Sebastian Westerholt from the Netherlands. 
Skipper Tushar Khandekar was the star to watch in the forward line and he has 
the seasoned and talented Sandeep Michael and Hariprasad to bolster the attack. 
Sunil and Cheyanna, two upcoming youngsters are the ones to watch out for in 
the frontline. <br><br> 
With their chief coach Ramesh Parameswaran joining the national duties, 
assistant coach and Olympian Ashish Ballal was in-charge of the coaching 
staff with another Junior India coach Edward Brient to assist him. Another 
former international CS Poonacha was the fitness trainer with the secretary 
of the Karnataka Hockey Association K Krishnamurthy as manager.<br><br>
